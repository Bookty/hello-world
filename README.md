Good day all, I'm Bookty.
I'm a highschool students who's messed around in the past with coding (primarily in Processing) and created a GitHub account for future projects. I'm interested in machine=learning, and have created a simple perceptron in the past. Outside of coding I'm interested in physics, tabletop RPGs, worldbuilding, and fantasy/sci-fi, among several otherr things.
